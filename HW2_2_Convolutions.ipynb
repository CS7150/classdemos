    "# Convolution via Toeplitz Matrices in PyTorch\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we explore how **discrete convolutions** (like those in neural networks) can be expressed as **ordinary matrix multiplications** when we unroll the sliding-window operation into **Toeplitz** (or Toeplitz-like) matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll do this in **two parts**:\n",
    "- **Part 1**: 1D convolution\n",
    "- **Part 2**: 2D convolution\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we will discuss:\n",
    "- **Weight Sharing**: Convolution weights are repeated (shifted) in a Toeplitz matrix, drastically reducing the number of parameters vs. a fully dense matrix.\n",
    "- **Translation Equivariance**: A key property of convolution is that if the input shifts, the output shifts in the same way (up to boundary effects), unlike a generic matrix multiplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Toeplitz?\n",
    "*Convolution* from a vector/matrix viewpoint is a linear transformation with a very particular structure. For a 1D kernel of length \\(K\\), we form a matrix whose rows are shifted copies of the kernel. In 2D, the idea extends to *block-Toeplitz* matrices. This structure imposes **weight sharing**â€”many entries of the large matrix are the **same** parameter. This reduces the degrees of freedom and imparts **equivariance** to shifts.\n",
